PINE64 Installer
================

This is a tool forked from [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) to add an easy menu for downloading the PINE A64(+), SOPINE or Pinebook OS images for flashing to the MicroSD card, saving users the extra steps of finding links on the web, downloading the image and finding the file on the local system.

- If "Eject on success" is ticked: After the flashing or validating process, the app will try to automatically unmount or eject the MicroSD card.
  - Occasionally, the MicroSD card may be accessed by another process running on your system, causing automatic unmounting or ejection to fail. In this case, you may need to manually unmount or eject the MicroSD card.
- If "Validate write on success" is ticked: after flashing, the app will read the MicroSD card and compare its final checksum with the previous flashing/writing checksum to validate successful writing of the image.
- Download Location: where the downloaded image file is stored. Click the far right button to change this location.
  - Remember your download location if you want to manually delete any old image files later.
  - The default download locations are:
    - Windows: C:\\Users\\&lt;USER&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\pine64-installer\\downloadedImage
    - Linux: /home/&lt;USER&gt;/.config/pine64-installer/downloadedImage
